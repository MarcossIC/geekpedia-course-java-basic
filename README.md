# Course of "La Geekipedia de Ernesto" 
## :sparkles: Introduction
In this repository you will find the content of a Java course for beginners that I took in 2019 (it's been 4 years since I learned Java).

This course is given by "Ernesto's geekpedia" on YouTube, although old and basic I have decided to upload this course, as it is my first Java programming course, I found it interesting to upload it to show what a code from someone who is just starting out is like. java (File names, variables, bad practices, etc.). Also at that time I still didn't know gitHub.

  The interesting and good thing about this course is that all the codes are written in notepad, something that is no longer done due to the convenience that many IDE's offer, but the reality is that starting out in Notepad made me have a Solid base and learn not to depend excessively on self-completions.
